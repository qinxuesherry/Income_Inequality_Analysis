# Income Inequality Analysis Project
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of global income inequality with a focus on how it correlates with various factors such as age, gender, race, and geographical region. Utilizing data from reputable sources like data.world.com and the U.S. Census Bureau, the project employs sophisticated statistical techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and advanced methods like Bootstrap, to delve into the underlying factors contributing to income distribution disparities.

## Objectives
To investigate the global trend of income inequality.
To analyze the impact of factors such as gender, race, age, and region on income inequality.
To explore the relationship between income level and these factors.
To offer insights that could assist in formulating targeted policies for a more equitable distribution of wealth.
## Data Sources
The analysis is based on three distinct datasets providing insights into income distribution from different perspectives:

**U.S. Income Data by Gender and Age**: Focused on exploring income variations across different age groups and between genders within the United States.

**U.S. Income Data by Racial Demographics**: Aimed at examining economic inequality patterns influenced by racial factors within the U.S.

**Global Income Distribution by Region**: Broad analysis of how income is distributed across various parts of the world, highlighting regional economic disparities.

## Methodology
**Data Collection**: Sourced from data.world.com and the U.S. Census Bureau.

**Data Cleaning**: Involved handling redundancies and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data completeness and reliability.

**Data Analysis**: Included EDA, hypothesis testing, and advanced statistical methods to explore the relationships between income inequality and various factors.

**Visualization**: Created visual representations of income distribution to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the data.

## Key Findings
Income inequality exists globally and is related to factors like age, gender, race, region, and the extent of development.
The extent of income inequality has worsened over time.
There is a significant relationship between these factors and income level, with developed regions and males showing higher income levels and greater dispersion.
The research highlights that income disparity is deeply rooted in structural and systemic inequalities.
## Conclusion
The project underscores the importance of understanding income inequality and its influencing factors. The insights derived from this analysis can aid in formulating more equitable policies and promoting a fairer distribution of wealth.
